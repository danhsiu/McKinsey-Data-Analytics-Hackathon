# McKinsey Analytics Online Hackathons

This repository contains my submissions for the McKinsey Analytics Online Hackathons. In Nov 2017 and Jan 2018, I took part in both McKinsey Analytics Online Hackathons, and was surprised by the difficulty of both challenges. However, I am glad that the hackathon provided me with a platform to apply my knowledge of Machine Learning to real-life problems.
